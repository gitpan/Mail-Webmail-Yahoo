If you've ever seen the above, this package might be for you. Frustrated by
the lack of bulk processing tools in Yahoo mail, I was prompted to write this
package. It allows you to download to your local machine all of the messages
in your Yahoo account, attachments included. Future versions will allow bulk
deletion, forwarding, and other useful mail functions.

This is version 0.3 of the Mail::Webmail::Yahoo package; it may therefore be
slightly brittle. While I have been testing it and using it on my own yahoo
accounts for several weeks, I would appreciate any feedback, positive or
negative.


Included in the distribution is a sample script, 'snagmail.pl', which should
be enough to get you started. It simply downloads the contents of your Yahoo
inbox and stores it to disk in mbox format. 

Call it with 

  snagmail.pl <yahoo username> <password> [<number of messages>]


Also included is 'sendhoo.pl', which can be used to send simple messages via
your yahoo account. Usage is:

  sendhoo.pl <yahoo username> <yahoo password> <to-list> <subject> <body>

where to-list is a comma-separated list of email addresses.
